## Game Description

Simon Game is a memory-based game where the player needs to remember and reproduce a sequence of randomly generated colors and sounds. The game starts with a single color and progressively adds one more color to the sequence each round. The player's task is to replicate the sequence correctly to advance to the next level. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the game interface.
- JavaScript: Used for game logic and interactivity.
- jQuery: Used as a JavaScript library to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.
